# Sudoku Solver 🧩  

## 📌 Overview
This is an AI-powered **Sudoku Solver** that reads a Sudoku puzzle from an image, processes it using **OpenCV and Machine Learning**, and provides the solved puzzle.

## 🚀 Features
- 🖼️ **Image-based Sudoku Solver**: Upload an image, and the solver extracts and solves the puzzle.
- 🔢 **OCR for Digit Recognition**: Uses **Machine Learning** and **OpenCV** for accurate digit detection.
- 🏎️ **Fast and Efficient**: Solves Sudoku puzzles in milliseconds.
- 📊 **User-friendly Interface**: Simple UI for easy interaction.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV** (for image processing)
- **NumPy** (for matrix operations)
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for digit recognition)
- **Flask/Streamlit** (for web-based UI - if applicable)

## 📷 How It Works
1. 🖼️ **Input**: Upload an image containing a Sudoku puzzle.
2. 🔍 **Preprocessing**: Image is processed using **OpenCV** to detect the Sudoku grid.
3. 🔢 **Digit Recognition**: ML-based model recognizes handwritten or printed digits.
4. 🧩 **Puzzle Solving**: Uses **Backtracking Algorithm** to compute the solution.
5. ✅ **Output**: Displays the solved Sudoku over the original image.

## 🎮 Usage
### **1️⃣ Running Locally**
#### **🔹 Prerequisites**
Make sure you have Python installed and the necessary dependencies.
